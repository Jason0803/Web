                            <p><strong> Abstract</strong>: The use of detailed building plans and models is common in the architecture domain. Also there is increasing interest in the reuse of such models to realise 3D interactive virtual environments to aid model refinement and for use as training environments, for example virtual site visits. Unfortunately, the development of interactive virtual environments is both time consuming and technically difficult. One successful approach is the reuse of gaming technology to provide the underlying virtual environment and to allow developers to focus on importing appropriate content, e.g. building geometry and textures. Building Information Modelling (BIM) provides a rich source of building data and is an ideal basis for constructing realistic virtual environments. This paper overviews virtual environment development issues and outlines conversion pipelines from BIM to virtual environment via game engines from the current literature. Also the conversion from BIM tool Revit to the Unity3D game engine is explored in a case study. A summary of conversion pipelines is presented and a number of challenges for future work identified.</p>

                              <p>&nbsp;<strong>Abstract</strong>: Since the introduction of simple measures of linear relationship such as Pearson's Correlation Coefficient, measures have been sought that will also describe non-linear relationships that may exist between a pair of variables. Currently there are a number of such methods, encompassing a range of sophistication and involving a range of computational effort. This work reports on some experiments with a computationally simple measure that operates using a division of input space into regularly spaced cells. The Distribution Area Ratio Correlation Coefficient (DARCC) compares the distribution of cells containing k points with a theoretical distribution. The method is described then evaluated by comparing the resulting correlation coefficient with the magnitude of added noise. Results show a good agreement between noise and DARCC for several synthesised datasets. The measure is also evaluated on some real datasets. DARCC is computationally very simple and has potential for datasets with a large number of variables where speed is important.</p>

                              <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Augmented Reality (AR) technology can provide a novel and interesting approach for presenting cultural heritage content to the general public. Recent advances in AR research and the quick uptake of powerful mobile devices now means AR systems are a viable option for heritage institutions, but there are still many challenges that must be overcome before high-quality AR experiences are commonplace. This paper examines published attempts at bringing AR systems to the heritage sector, and highlights and discusses the ongoing trends and challenges that are faced in this area.</p>

                              <p><strong> Authors</strong>: Athauda, Rukshan I.; Ahn, Euijoon </p>
                              <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Configuring optimal access control is a difficult task in today's complex IT environments. Too restrictive access control leads to frustration by users, while excessive privileges leads to vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, the problem of verifying safety - i.e. no rights can be leaked to an unauthorised principal - for an arbitrary configuration of a general access model is shown to be undecidable. In this paper, a practical methodology and framework is proposed to elicit access control rights stealthily while users perform tasks in a test environment that mimic a real-production environment. To illustrate the feasibility of the framework, a prototype is implemented and presented.</p>

                            <div class="st-content">
                              <p><strong><a href="http://ogma.newcastle.edu.au:8080/vital/access/manager/Repository/uon:13440">3. Simplicity: a design pattern for ideas </a></strong></p>
                              <p><strong> Authors</strong>: Nesbitt, Keith </p>
                              <p> <strong>Abstract</strong>: Nature is composed of many complex systems. No system is more complex than the nature that governs the creation of ideas. Yet how many patterns are needed to model such complexity? The search for common patterns that govern the nature of complex systems is a fundamental goal of both science and art. New ideas may provide solutions to such problems but then the question arises as to how ideas are created, and whether they might be created in the same form? Creating ideas is in essence a design problem. Problems require solutions and ideas are designed to provide them. One way to solve common design problems is to adopt, or adapt, a solution that has been useful in the past. Design patterns are intended as a more formal way of capturing these good designs, or design practices, so they can be reused. Although patterns were first introduced in the realm of Architecture they were quickly adopted by the Software Engineering community. In this paper, the use of patterns is adapted to the more general realm of idea generation. In particular this paper introduces a specific design pattern call Simplicity that is intended to help with the practical exploration of a dynamic design space that is complete and allows for both inconsistent states and yet overall consistency. Simplicity is a pattern that reframes a number of well-known concepts such as complimentary dualities, recursion, self-similarity and symmetry to try and provide an alternative understanding of the way ideas are created and contextualised. This paper, as it stands is incomplete, requiring much further mathematical formalisation to take it beyond the current pattern definition. Despite this shortfall, it is hoped that the current description may provide a useful step in the search for fundamental patterns that allow for unification of ideas across disciplines, a notion that has been termed Consilience.</p>
